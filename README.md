# MC Form Grid

A library for creating easy form and form labels laid out inside a CSS grid, with easily customizable columns.

Set any number of columns in width, label your form elements, and decide how many column widths you want them to take up.

Labels can align left or right, and will expand to the width of the widest label unless you specify a max-width.

Use mc-form-divider to split sections of your form, and use mc-form-custom to add form elements that are not input/select/textarea elements - eg. buttons, radio elements, descriptive text.

Specify your FormControl and provide an errors object to display errors on the FormControl automatically.

Import @NgBootstrap to append a descriptive popover icon at the end of an <input> field.
